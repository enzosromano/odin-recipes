This project was intended as a hands on introduction to basic HTML. 
It consists of a simple 3 paged website and includes some lists, headings and images.

Once you navigate away from the landing page (index.html), all other pages have a hyperlink that will help you navigate back there.

This project helped me become familiar with lists, anchors, text formatting, images, links, and project structuring.
